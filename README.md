# Deepfake Detection Using GenConViT and FreqNet with Ensemble-Based Web Inference

> Ensemble-based deepfake detection system powered by GenConViT, FreqNet, and Vision Transformer. Includes a web-based inference interface using Flask for real-time image/video verification.

---

## Project Overview

The system integrates:
- **GenConViT Autoencoder + VAE** (Generative Convolutional Vision Transformer)
- **FreqNet** (Frequency-Aware CNN)
- **ViT** (Vision Transformer from HuggingFace)

It combines **spatial**, **frequency**, and **latent representation** learning to classify media as `REAL` or `FAKE`.

## 🛠️ Installation Instructions

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Run the Web App

After installing the dependencies and activating the virtual environment:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Model Inference Summary

| Model            | Input Type  | Method             | Output      |
|------------------|------------ |--------------------|-------------|
| GenConViT-AE     | Image/Video | Reconstruction     | Real/Fake   |
| GenConViT-VAE    | Image/Video | Latent Analysis    | Real/Fake   |
| FreqNet          | Image/Video | FFT-based Learning | Real/Fake   |
| ViT              | Image       | Transformer-Based  | Real/Fake   |

### Ensemble Voting
- Majority voting across 4 models.
- Confidence is averaged from all model outputs.
